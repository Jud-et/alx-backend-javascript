🏆 0x00-ES6 Basic 🏆
Welcome to the 0x00-ES6 Basic repository! 🚀 This project is a dive into the fundamentals of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and showcases various ES6 features through hands-on tasks. Let’s explore the tasks and what you'll need to achieve them! 🎯

📜 Tasks Overview
1. Block Scope 🏗️
Objective: Understand and apply block scope with let and const keywords.

Requirement: Create a block scope to test the behavior of let and const within different blocks.

2. Arrow Functions ➡️
Objective: Use arrow functions to simplify your code.

Requirement: Convert traditional functions into arrow functions and observe the changes.

3. Default Parameters 🔢
Objective: Implement functions with default parameters.

Requirement: Create functions that use default values for parameters when none are provided.

4. Rest Parameters 🌌
Objective: Use rest parameters to handle functions with varying numbers of arguments.

Requirement: Modify functions to accept and handle a variable number of arguments.

5. Spread Operator 🌟
Objective: Use the spread operator to spread elements of an array or object.

Requirement: Demonstrate the use of the spread operator in combining arrays and objects.

6. Take Advantage 📈
Objective: Utilize destructuring and object property shorthand to simplify code.

Requirement: Refactor code to use destructuring and shorthand syntax for cleaner, more readable code.

7. Object Property Value Shorthand Syntax ✨
Objective: Apply the object property value shorthand syntax to reduce redundancy.

Requirement: Refactor objects to use shorthand syntax where applicable.

8. Enhanced Object Literals 🔍
Objective: Use enhanced object literals for more concise object definitions.

Requirement: Create objects using enhanced literal syntax for cleaner and more efficient code.

9. Computed Property Names 🧩
Objective: Use computed property names in object literals.

Requirement: Implement object properties using computed names.

10. Method Properties 🛠️
Objective: Define methods within objects using shorthand syntax.

Requirement: Implement methods in objects using the concise method syntax.

11. Creating Employees Object 👩‍💼👨‍💼
Objective: Write a function to create an employee object.

Requirement: Create a function that generates employee objects based on given data.

12. Creating Report Object 📊
Objective: Develop a function to create a report object from employee data.

Requirement: Create a function that generates a report object containing employee data.

13. Iterating Through Report Objects 🔄
Objective: Write a function to iterate through every employee in the report object.

Requirement: Implement an iterator to traverse through all employees in the report.

14. Iterate Through Object 🔍
Objective: Create a function that formats all employee names into a string.

Requirement: Join all employee names into a single string, separated by |.
